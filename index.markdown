Hello! My name is Joshua French, and welcome to my new homepage! I graduated with a degree in Mathematics from Arizona State University in 2022. I hope to use the skills I acquired there and my computer programming knowledge to pursue a career in data analytics and software development.

I have learned several programming languages and libraries, both in school and on by myself, and continue to teach myself others. For more information see my [Resume](resume) here or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-french-07774a150)
